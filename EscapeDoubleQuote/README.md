Details

looking for shell scripting programmer to extract data from CSV file.
The files are Pipe(|) delimited where each column is enclosed in double quotes. There are few columns which have double quotes as part of the data, those double quotes needs to replaced with escape character followed by quote (/"). 

The first row of the file contains header.
The script should be reusable shell script which accepts any delimiter (comma,pipe mostly), source file names and places file in the desired location.
Calling the script: EscapeDoubleQuote.sh [Delimiter] [SourceFileName] [TargetFileName]
